## Product Overview

Status.im has ideas for a DApp idea collective commons, and we want the SNT Holders to have the ability to vote on these and decide a winner

- UI to allow SNT holders to vote / cancel vote 
- UI to view details about an item
- UI to create voting items by the contract owner
- Use contracts from Idea #172 for creation of proposals and to handle voting.
- After N blocks a votation is closed and results tabulated

### Iteration 1

Description: 
- Design / Prototypes are created
- Design and layout of dApp is updated
- SNT holders may create items to vote

### Iteration 2
